# Releases and caching

## Choose the date that controls coding

Pass the date on which the codes must be valid:

| Coding context                                 | Date to pass to `for_date()` |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| ICD-10-CM for an inpatient stay                | Discharge date               |
| ICD-10-CM for an outpatient or other encounter | Encounter or date of service |
| ICD-10-PCS                                     | Inpatient discharge date     |

Do not use the date on which CMS published, corrected, or downloaded a file.
Those administrative dates do not necessarily change which codes apply.

```python
from datetime import date

from cms_icd import ICD10KnowledgeBase

# Inpatient CM and PCS materials for a discharge on April 1, 2025.
icd = ICD10KnowledgeBase.for_date(date(2025, 4, 1))
```

The date passed to `for_date()` controls both `.cm` and `.pcs`. If an
application is handling records governed by different dates, create a separate
knowledge base for each date.

## Fiscal years and revisions

CMS fiscal years begin on October 1. `for_date()` calculates the fiscal year and
selects the latest advertised revision effective on or before the relevant
coding date. CMS-backed discovery covers production ICD-10 releases from FY
2016 onward.

```pycon
>>> from datetime import date
>>> from cms_icd.sources import fiscal_year_for
>>> fiscal_year_for(date(2025, 9, 30))
2025
>>> fiscal_year_for(date(2025, 10, 1))
2026

```

Use `from_cms()` to pin an exact fiscal-year snapshot for a reproducible
dataset, model, or audit:

```python
icd = ICD10KnowledgeBase.from_cms(
    fiscal_year=2026,
    release_date=date(2026, 4, 1),
)
```

If `release_date` is omitted, October 1 before the fiscal year is used. The
requested date must be an effective revision advertised by CMS; an arbitrary
date such as February 1 is not accepted as an exact snapshot.

## How midyear updates work

CMS commonly starts a fiscal year with an October 1 release and publishes
additional files effective April 1. Both dates belong to the same fiscal year:

```pycon
>>> fiscal_year_for(date(2025, 3, 31))
2025
>>> fiscal_year_for(date(2025, 4, 1))
2025

```

The April update is not necessarily a complete replacement of every material.
A snapshot resolves each material independently:

1. Use an artifact effective on the requested revision when CMS published one.
2. Otherwise inherit the latest earlier artifact in the same fiscal year.
3. Never inherit an artifact from a different fiscal year.

For example, the currently advertised snapshots resolve as follows:

| Snapshot          | CM tables/index | CM guidelines     | PCS tables/index | PCS guidelines    |
| ----------------- | --------------- | ----------------- | ---------------- | ----------------- |
| FY2025, October 1 | October         | October           | October          | October           |
| FY2025, April 1   | April           | October inherited | April            | October inherited |
| FY2026, October 1 | October         | October           | October          | October           |
| FY2026, April 1   | April           | October inherited | April            | April             |

Consequently, two knowledge bases in the same fiscal year can contain different
codes:

```python
before_update = ICD10KnowledgeBase.for_date(date(2025, 3, 31))
after_update = ICD10KnowledgeBase.for_date(date(2025, 4, 1))
```

The live integration suite verifies this boundary using a PCS code that is
absent from the FY2025 October tables and present in the April tables.

## Guideline support

`cms-icd` supports the official CMS ICD-10-CM and ICD-10-PCS guideline files
associated with a snapshot. Availability in the CMS catalog, as checked in
July 2026, is:

| Fiscal year   | ICD-10-CM guidelines     | ICD-10-PCS guidelines | Revision behavior                             |
| ------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| FY2016–FY2024 | Supported                | Supported             | Annual October guideline                      |
| FY2025        | Supported                | Supported             | October guideline inherited by April snapshot |
| FY2026        | Supported                | Supported             | CM inherits October; PCS has an April update  |
| FY2027        | Not yet published by CMS | Supported             | October 2026 PCS guideline is advertised      |

The package raises
[`ReleaseUnavailableError`](../reference/exceptions.md) when CMS does not
provide a requested guideline. It does not silently substitute a guideline from
another fiscal year.

CMS availability can change as new files are published. See the official
[current ICD-10 files](https://www.cms.gov/medicare/coding-billing/icd-10-codes)
and [ICD-10 archive](https://www.cms.gov/medicare/coding-billing/icd-10-codes/icd-10-cm-icd-10-pcs-gem-archive)
for the source catalog.

Guidelines are loaded independently of tables and indexes:

```python
cm_guidelines = icd.cm.guidelines
pcs_guidelines = icd.pcs.guidelines
```

## Strict selection and fallback

Snapshot selection is strict by default. If CMS does not advertise the
requested revision for any supported material, accessing its first material
raises
[`ReleaseUnavailableError`](../reference/exceptions.md).

An application may explicitly permit the latest available material in the same
fiscal year:

```python
icd = ICD10KnowledgeBase.from_cms(
    fiscal_year=2026,
    release_date=date(2026, 4, 1),
    fallback="latest_for_fy",
)
```

> [!WARNING]
> A fallback can change cohort labels or coding behavior. Record the resolved
> release and use fallback only when that scientific or operational tradeoff
> is acceptable.

## Cache behavior

By default, files are cached under:

```text
${XDG_CACHE_HOME}/cms-icd
```

or `~/.cache/cms-icd` when `XDG_CACHE_HOME` is not set. Set `cache_dir` to keep
artifacts with a project or shared application cache:

```python
icd = ICD10KnowledgeBase.for_date(
    date(2026, 5, 1),
    cache_dir="data/cms_icd",
)
```

Downloaded artifacts are keyed by URL, checksummed with SHA-256, and reused when
one CMS bundle supplies multiple lazy stores. Extraction uses a directory lock
and an atomic staging rename so concurrent readers do not observe partial
materials.

Each extracted material directory contains `manifest.json` with the source URL,
release metadata, artifact checksum, extracted filenames, and a checksum for
each extracted file. Checksums are revalidated before reuse; corrupt or
incomplete cache entries are rebuilt automatically.
